# Bookings with React/Redux

This is a simple Booking.com clone that I created with React and Redux as part of [Le Wagon's](http://www.lewagon.com) React and Redux course. In this app, users can click on a flat from the list, which the selected flat's location is then displayed with a marker on the map.

This is a reiteration of the [Airbnb coding exercise](http://www.github.com/wcyjoyce/airbnb) done earlier, but with the incorporation of Redux elements. It is also my first Redux app! :home:
